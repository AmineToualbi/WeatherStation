# WeatherStation

Hardware code implement in an Arduino mounted with different sensors to build a weather station prototype. 

Developed as an undergraduate researcher during the summer 2018. 

Efficiency was improvement by 70% by using an algorithm keeping track of the state of the distance sensors when a person walks in front of the device. 

Requested by the Geography Department at Bridgewater State University to study the correlation between student movements and weather.
